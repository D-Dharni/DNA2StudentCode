I realized that you have to isolate the part of checking each word because the number of things to check can't be modified. |
| October 19 | 3:00-4:25  | I reviewed my previous worklog and then I started to think through how exactly I could solve the issue. I settled that because the length of the string or n was the thing that you could change in the algorithm the key to efficiency has to be something in that. I noticed that in the old way of solving the problem there were a lot of rechecks involved when trying to check for all of the strings. I started to think about how to get rid of the checks. First I was thinking about how to do it going forwards through the string but I realized that a way to limit repetitiveness would be to instead of approaching it from the start of the str sequence, to do it from the back. So, if you have an array the size of the list. I know this takes up a ton of memory so I'm going to have to figure out a way for it to take up less. Essentially, you start from the back and you set the starting of the str repeat to 1 plus how ever many repeats start right after it. That way by the time you get to the front most one you can just access it and you instantly get the value for how many there are and don't have to loop back through and count it. If it doesn't match then you simply set that index to 0. This works more efficiently because this way you only check each position once and you don't restart searches when you don't need to. In the initial algorithm each starting position doesn't know what's at later positions, so it has to restart the search. All in all, I think this algorithm improves the runtime but has a big trade-off for memory that I am going to have to figure out. I also wrote in some pseudocode for this. |
